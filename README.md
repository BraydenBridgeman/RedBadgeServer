This server is providing the backend of my React application.
In building this, various controllers were needed. 
In hindsight, I could have combined a lot of the controllers, but building out the controllers individually helped me in the short term.
If I come back to this project, I'll probably start by combining most of the controllers together in order to make a smoother experience for the code.
